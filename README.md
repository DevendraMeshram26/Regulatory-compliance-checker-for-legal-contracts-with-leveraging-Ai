- **Compliance Analysis:** Uses **LLM** to assess legal risks and provide recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction.
- **Secure & Scalable:** Implements best practices for **data privacy and deployment**.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Database:** Chromadb
- **AI/LLM:** Groq Cloud API
- **Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline

## Installation & Setup
